## abstract
#### Contemporary Chemical and biological industrial processes are characterized by strong and unknown nonlinearities and measurement noise, and their operational process states are complex. These have led to frequent false alarms and missed alarms in the existing monitoring system. In order to accurately obtain the operating status of industrial processes and detect their abnormal operation, an interpretable early fault detection method based on deep learning LSTM-AE and Shap algorithms is proposed. First, a prediction model based on long short-term memory (LSTM) network is established to build an early fault detection model. Then, to improve the interpretability of the model, an interpretable algorithm, Shapely additive explanation, is used to infer the global and local contribution of each feature to the prediction for attribution analysis. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is verified on real industrial data. The results show that the method can provide a theoretical basis for the safe operation and condition-based maintenance of chemical processes.
